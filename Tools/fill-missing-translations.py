"""Add MISSING translations to an Apple String Catalog, never overwriting existing ones.

Why this exists alongside `translate-de.py`: that script carries a full German dictionary and is the
source of truth for the keys it holds, but it only covers a few hundred of the catalog's 4 500+ keys,
and there is no equivalent for the other seven languages. Writing a full dictionary per language is
not practical; what IS needed regularly is "a batch of new keys just landed, give every language its
unit". That is exactly what this does — additively, idempotently, and for any language.

Rules, deliberately narrow:
  • A key that already has a localization for that language is left ALONE. Existing translations are
    never touched, so a re-run after a hand correction cannot silently revert it.
  • A key that is not in the catalog at all is SKIPPED and reported. The catalog's key set comes from
    the compiler's extraction, not from this file — inventing keys here would produce entries that no
    call site ever looks up, which reads as "translated" while showing English on device.
  • Printf specifiers must match the key's, or the entry is refused. A translation that drops a `%@`
    crashes formatting at runtime and is what `Tools/i18n_audit.py`'s format check exists to catch.

Usage:
  python3 Tools/fill-missing-translations.py                    # every language, both catalogs
  python3 Tools/fill-missing-translations.py --check            # report only, write nothing
