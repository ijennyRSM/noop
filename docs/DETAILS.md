👈 Looking for the friendly tour? **[Back to the README](../README.md)**

This is the technical deep-dive: the fork rationale, the full 25-tool table, token-cost mechanics,
the architecture, build/signing minutiae, and where this fork stands relative to upstream today. If
you just want to know what the app does and how to get it running, the README has everything you
need — this page is for when you want to know *why*, or you're about to touch the code yourself.

## Why a fork, not a contribution upstream?

NOOP AI is a **personal fork** of [ryanbr/noop](https://github.com/ryanbr/noop). Not a competitor,
not a rebrand that hides where it came from. Every protocol decoder, every analytics formula, every
pixel of the design system comes from upstream NOOP and its own credited sources (see
[Attribution](#attribution-in-full)). What this fork adds on top is **a much bigger coach** — and
that addition is Apple-only.

Upstream NOOP runs on a hard rule: **analytics and stored data must be byte-identical between the
Swift and Kotlin implementations.** That's exactly the right rule for a dependable cross-platform
WHOOP client — but it means every feature has to earn its place on macOS, iOS *and* Android at
once, kept in lockstep, forever.

A fast-moving, opinionated AI coach is precisely the kind of thing that rule *should* keep out of
the core project. It doesn't need an Android twin, and it doesn't need to be re-derived in Kotlin to
be worth having. It needs to iterate quickly, for one person. So rather than push upstream toward a
"no" it would be right to give, it lives here.

**What that means in practice:**

- **Apple platforms, both of them.** This fork builds and tests `NOOPiOS` (iOS 17+) *and* `Strand`
  (macOS 13+) — the coach's shared files have to compile for both, and `StrandTests` runs under the
  macOS scheme, so macOS isn't merely carried along: it is where the test suite executes. **As of
  2026-07-23, Android is dropped as a target entirely** — not merely carried along for merge
  convenience — and the cross-platform parity contract that drove the byte-identical rule above is
  formally retired for this fork. Dropping Android parity is also what unblocked iOS-only system
  surface this fork wouldn't otherwise have bothered with — a home-screen widget and a Siri
  "How's my recovery?" intent, for instance, that would have needed an Android twin before.
- **Additive only.** Everything this fork adds lives in its own new files under `Strand/AI/`. No
  upstream logic is rewritten in place. Nothing touches BLE, protocol decoding, or the analytics
  math — the parts that genuinely benefit from cross-platform parity are left completely alone.
- **It worked, while merging was the practice.** Upstream `9.0.0` and `9.0.1` both merged cleanly
  into this fork before the 2026-07-23 pivot — between them exactly one merge conflict, ever, and not
  one coach file ever needed a manual merge. The additive-files design is *why* that was painless; see
  [Relationship to upstream today](#relationship-to-upstream-today) for where things stand now.

## The coach's 26 tools, in full

The README covers the idea (the coach fetches its own data instead of being handed a fixed
summary); here's every tool it can reach for, mid-sentence, while answering you. `get_readiness`
and `get_charge_drivers` in particular read from the **exact same engines** the Today screen does,
so the coach's verdict can never contradict what you already see there.

| | Tool | What it pulls |
|---|---|---|
| 📊 | `get_biometric_summary` | 14 days of charge/effort/rest/HRV/RHR + 30-day averages |
| 🏃 | `get_recent_workouts` | Your recent sessions, with effort and heart rate |
| 😰 | `get_stress_index` | Today's autonomic load (Baevsky index over your R-R intervals) |
| 😴 | `get_sleep_detail` | Per-night stages, efficiency, and your rolling sleep-debt ledger |
| 📅 | `get_range_report` | Any 7–365 day window: averages, trends, headline changes |
| 🗂️ | `get_data_catalog` | Metadata-only local discovery of available metric history, with focused matching kept on-device |
| 📆 | `get_metric_history` | One selected source's compact, aggregate long-term trend — never raw readings |
| 🔁 | `get_training_preferences` | Conservative repeated accepted/declined plan patterns; it never changes a plan |
| 🎯 | `get_readiness` | The same push/maintain/rest verdict Today shows — ACWR, training monotony, contributing signals |
| 🔬 | `get_charge_drivers` | *Why* today's Charge is what it is, term by term — never an invented reason |
| 📝 | `propose_plan` | Suggests a session. Never schedules one — that's your call, in the app |
| ⚖️ | `get_session_outlook` · `simulate_day` | What a session (or a swap, or a hypothetical) actually costs, from your own history |
| ✅ | `get_plan_adherence` | What you agreed to vs. what happened — and why, when you told it |
| 🔍 | `get_personal_patterns` | Your own n-of-1 correlations ("late meals cost you 8 % recovery") |
| 📈 | `plot_metric` | Draws a real chart, inline in the chat |
| 🧠 | `remember_fact` · `update_fact` · `forget_fact` | Its own long-term memory |
| 🕰️ | `search_past_conversations` | Finds what you discussed weeks ago — by keyword, by day, or both ("what did I ask you yesterday?") |
| 📓 | `get_my_logs` | Reads back what you logged: caffeine, journal, lab markers, hydration, mood |
| 🔒 | `get_sensitive_logs` | Reads only explicitly requested sensitive journal fields, after its separate extra permission |
| 💓 | `get_zone_minutes` | Minutes per heart-rate zone, so a prescribed intensity can be checked rather than assumed |
| ☕ | `log_caffeine` · `log_journal` · `log_lab_marker` | **Writes** to your real app data |

That last row is the fun one: **"just had a double espresso"** becomes a genuine entry in the
Caffeine card. **"drank last night"** becomes a journal entry. **"my Vitamin D came back at 38"**
becomes a Lab Book marker. Same data the app always had — just logged by talking instead of tapping
through a form.

**Access to all 26 is gated per purpose, not by one switch.** Every tool belongs to exactly one of
nine `CoachPurpose` groups — `coreBiometrics`, `longHistory`, `workouts`, `planning`, `stress`, `logs`,
`sensitiveLogs`, `memory`, `patterns` — via an exhaustive `switch`, so a new tool literally can't ship
without being assigned a group. Essentials, Personal and Deep insights are simple presets over these
groups; Expert mode exposes the individual controls. Sensitive logs remain a separate extra choice.

📖 The full schema for every one of these — parameters, gating, the two safety gates, the plan
book's state machine, the memory ranking algorithm — lives in **[`COACH.md`](COACH.md)**.

## Token cost and prompt caching

Anthropic conversations get an explicit **prompt cache breakpoint**: the tool loop's largest
recurring cost — the tool-definition list and system prompt, re-sent on every round of a multi-round
answer — is cached after the first hit. Because a cache can silently fail to engage below a length
threshold rather than erroring, Settings shows a **plain-language card** after every question:
cached, just written, or "no caching, and here's probably why" — a number, not a hope.

**Token counts are no longer Anthropic-only.** The OpenAI-shaped providers report usage too, and it
matters more there: on OpenRouter *you* pick the model, from a catalogue spanning three orders of
magnitude in price. Shipping model choice without any way to see what a turn cost would leave the
one decision you actually make unmeasurable. Their `prompt_tokens` includes cached tokens where
Anthropic's `input_tokens` excludes them, so the parser subtracts — a turn means the same thing
whatever produced it.

## Under the hood: the architecture

If you like knowing how the sausage is made — the layering is genuinely nice, and it's upstream's
design, not this fork's:

| Layer | Where | What lives there |
|---|---|---|
| **Protocol** | `Packages/WhoopProtocol` | Raw BLE frames → structs. CRC-checked, pure Swift, no CoreBluetooth. Builds and tests on Linux. |
| **Storage** | `Packages/WhoopStore` | SQLite via GRDB. Migrations, caches. |
| **Analytics** | `Packages/StrandAnalytics` | The actual science: HRV, recovery, strain, sleep. Database-free, pure functions. |
| **Design system** | `Packages/StrandDesign` | Palette, components, charts. UI uses tokens only — no hardcoded colours. |
| **App** | `Strand/`, `StrandiOS/` | CoreBluetooth, the Repository, the screens, `RootTabView`. |
| **The coach** 🆕 | `Strand/AI/` | Everything this fork adds. All new files. |

The rule that keeps this fork sane: **the more wire-level or math-level a change is, the deeper
into `Packages/` it belongs — and the more it must be covered by tests that run with no app, no
strap, and no Bluetooth.** The coach sits at the very top of that stack and pulls from it through
the same consent-gated summaries the UI uses.

One piece worth naming inside `Strand/AI/`: **`CoachNotifier`** is what decides category, priority
and relevance-window for anything that reaches the user outside the chat itself — a proposed session
versus a proactive hint versus a status reminder, each rendered and actioned differently in the
bell. It's the mechanism behind what the README sells as "the coach decides what reaches you, and
how"; see `docs/COACH.md` §11a for the full mapping.

## Quickstart: the signing fine print

The README's Quickstart gets you to `⌘R`. Here's what's actually going on with a free Apple ID,
and the two trade-offs it carries — both already handled in `project.yml`:

- **The Watch app and widget are excluded from the iOS build.** A free account gets no App Groups
  and only 10 app IDs per 7 days, and every embedded extension burns one. The main app and every
  coach feature are unaffected. Got a paid account? Both are one line each to re-enable, documented
  inline in `project.yml`.
- **Free-signed apps expire after 7 days.** Reconnect and ⌘R to renew. (Note that `xcodegen
  generate` clears the Team field — reselect it, or pin `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` in `project.yml`.)

## Relationship to upstream today

**As of 2026-07-23, this fork is Apple-only and no longer necessarily tracks upstream — it diverges
freely.** Android is dropped as a target, and the cross-platform parity contract that used to
require every feature to land on macOS, iOS *and* Android in lockstep is formally retired. What's
still binding, and unrelated to that retirement: the app stays fully offline, on-device, no server,
no account, no cloud sync, no telemetry, anonymous — see `CLAUDE.md`. Currently **815 commits ahead,
0 behind** upstream/main (re-check with `git rev-list --left-right --count upstream/main...HEAD`;
this number moves and isn't maintained here).

That doesn't make upstream irrelevant — a protocol fix or analytics correction landing there might
still be worth pulling in on purpose. The mechanism that used to be standing practice still works
fine for that, on demand:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ryanbr/noop.git   # once
git fetch upstream --tags
git merge upstream/main    # keep this fork's README/branding + project.yml signing
```

Because every fork-specific change lives in its own file rather than editing upstream code in
place, a merge stays clean when you do reach for one — historically (before the pivot) `Strand/AI/`
never needed a manual conflict resolution across two upstream merges. If you do pull a later
upstream release, watch for one thing: `Tools/i18n_audit.py` gates German, Spanish and French
coverage as a *standing invariant*, so a merge that adds upstream UI text needs upstream's own
translations to already cover it — which they historically have; it's new **fork** strings that
need adding by hand.
