// MARK: - Heute-Screen redesign palette (docs/design/design-spec.md, docs/design/mockup-heute.html)
//
// A SEPARATE, additive token set — `StrandPalette` is untouched. Two reasons this can't just reuse
// `StrandPalette`:
//   1. `StrandPalette.chargeColor`/`.effortColor`/`.restColor` are chart-style-DEPENDENT computed
//      properties (they vary with the user's classic/health/aurora/sunset/forest/titanium/signature
//      setting); only `.signature` happens to equal this screen's green/blue/violet. The redesign
//      spec requires these three FIXED regardless of chart style ("reserviert" — design-spec §0.4).
//   2. The redesign's near-black tile/background/ink scale doesn't match any existing `StrandPalette`
//      surface token (e.g. `surfaceBase` dark `#121518` vs. this screen's `bg` `#000000`).
// Values are transcribed verbatim from the mockup's `:root[data-theme]` blocks — mockup is the binding
// visual reference where design-spec.md's prose is imprecise.
