// MARK: - Finale Zusammensetzung (docs/design/design-spec.md §5)
//
// Assembles the four parts with the spacing table from design-spec §5 and loads real data from
// `Repository`. `status` is owned HERE (not inside `ActivityStatusChip`) and threaded to both the
// header chip and the Basiskarte as the same value — otherwise changing status via the chip's sheet
// wouldn't be reflected in the base card, which is the whole point of feature-spec §1/§2.
//
// Data-loading COMPOSES the same carry-over selectors the other two Today screens use — it does not
// re-implement them. This screen used to carry forward "the most recent non-nil value ≤ the selected day"
// for EVERYTHING (Charge, Effort, vitals alike), which is a different rule from the one classic/Liquid
// agree on and could therefore show a different number for the same day:
//  • recovery-derived (Charge) goes through `TodayView.lastScoredRecoveryDay` + `LiquidTodayView
//    .ChargeDisplay.resolve`, so a mid-calibration wearer reads the honest "Learning your baseline, N of
//    4 nights" here too, instead of a stale prior score presented as today's.
//  • raw vitals (HRV / resting HR / respiratory / SpO₂) go through `Repository.lastVitalsDay` /
//    `lastSpo2Day`, which are recovery-INDEPENDENT (a night with real HRV but no recovery is a valid
//    source for a vital, but NOT for Charge — that asymmetry is the whole point of having two selectors).
// `LiquidChargeCarryTests` pins the composition for Liquid on the same basis: "the selection itself is
// NOT re-implemented here … so Liquid and Classic cannot drift." Heute now participates in that.
