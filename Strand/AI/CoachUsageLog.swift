/// Per-turn token accounting for the coach's own API calls. On-device only: these counters are read from
/// the provider's reply, shown in Coach settings, and never stored or sent anywhere.
///
/// This exists for one reason. Anthropic's prompt cache only engages once the cached prefix clears a
/// model-dependent minimum length; below it the cache silently does nothing — no error, no warning, no
/// saving. Without the counters there is no way to tell "caching works" from "caching never engaged", so
/// the numbers ship alongside the feature rather than as an afterthought.
///
/// It is no longer Anthropic-only. The OpenAI-shaped providers report `usage` too, and the counters
/// matter MORE there: on OpenRouter the user picks the model and therefore its price, across a catalogue
/// spanning three orders of magnitude in cost. Shipping model choice without any way to see what a turn
/// cost leaves the one decision the user actually makes unmeasurable. Their `prompt_tokens` includes
/// cached tokens where Anthropic's `input_tokens` excludes them — `parseOpenAIUsage` subtracts, so a
/// `Round` means the same thing whatever produced it.
///
/// A *turn* is one user question, which the tool loop may spread across several requests (see
/// `AnthropicClient.maxToolRounds`); each request is one `Round`.
