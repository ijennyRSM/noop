/// Deterministic safety check on the RATE a goal demands. Pure, testable, and evaluated BEFORE and
/// INDEPENDENTLY of the language model.
///
/// WHY THIS IS CODE AND NOT A PROMPT: a language model asked "is losing 20 kg in two months safe?"
/// will usually say no — and "usually" is not a safety property. The hard line lives here, where it can
/// be tested against a table of cases; the model only ever narrates the verdict it is handed.
///
/// IT WARNS, IT DOES NOT BLOCK. Legitimate exceptions exist and matter: a bodybuilder in a deliberate
/// cut phase, someone starting from a very high body weight, anyone under medical supervision. Refusing
/// those outright would be both paternalistic and wrong. So a flagged rate asks for a reason, records
/// it (`CoachGoal.RiskAcknowledgement`), and then lets the user proceed with their eyes open.
///
/// WHY THE RATE IS RELATIVE, NOT ABSOLUTE: 1 kg/week is a very different proposition at 180 kg than at
/// 60 kg. Expressing the rate as a PERCENTAGE of the user's own body weight per week normalises that
/// automatically, so a heavier person is not flagged for a rate that is, proportionally, the same as a
/// lighter person's unflagged one. That single choice handles the obesity case without special-casing it.
///
/// SCOPE: this judges the rate a goal implies. It is not medical advice and NOOP is not a medical
/// device (see DISCLAIMER.md). Note also that NOOP holds no nutrition data whatsoever, so for a weight
/// goal the coach tracks the number and plans TRAINING around it — it never prescribes a diet, which is
/// where body-weight change is actually won or lost.
