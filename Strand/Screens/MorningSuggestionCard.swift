/// question and one for the answer, never two rows for the same session.
///
/// It carries its own opt-in trigger: on a new logical day, opening (or resuming) Today generates the
/// brief — which, with tools live, records exactly one proposal (W5). The generation itself is entirely
/// `AICoachEngine.startBriefIfNeeded()`, which already owns the once-per-logical-day lock; nothing new
/// happens in the engine.
///
/// Deliberately NO dismiss control: it's opt-in, it self-hides the moment the proposal is decided, and
/// Decline IS the dismiss. That also sidesteps TodayView's dismiss-switch `default: break` trap and
/// LiquidTodayView's lack of a dismiss path entirely.
